# Array
This Repo contains all the searching & sorting techniques in Array.

**Searching:** Linear Search, Binary Search
**Sorting:** Selection Sort, BUbble Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort & Quick Sort.



**Talking about Complexities:**

**Linear Search:**
Best Case Complexity: O(1)
Average Case Complexity: O(n)
Worst Case Complexity: O(n)



**Binary Search (for sorted arrays):**
Best Case Complexity: O(1)
Average Case Complexity: O(log n)
Worst Case Complexity: O(log n)

**Bubble Sort:**
Best Case Complexity: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
Average Case Complexity: O(n^2)
Worst Case Complexity: O(n^2)

**Selection Sort:**
Best Case Complexity: O(n^2)
Average Case Complexity: O(n^2)
Worst Case Complexity: O(n^2)


**Insertion Sort:**
Best Case Complexity: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
Average Case Complexity: O(n^2)
Worst Case Complexity: O(n^2)


**Merge Sort:**
Best Case Complexity: O(n log n)
Average Case Complexity: O(n log n)
Worst Case Complexity: O(n log n)


**Quick Sort:**
Best Case Complexity: O(n log n)
Average Case Complexity: O(n log n)
Worst Case Complexity: O(n^2) (rare, but can occur if the pivot selection is not optimal)
